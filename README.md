# CarND Term1 Starter Kit
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

The purpose of this project is to provide unified software dependency support for students enrolled in Term 1 of the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). 

Python 3 is used for entirety of term 1.

There are two ways to get up and running:

## [Anaconda Environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/)  

Get started [here](docs/configure_via_anaconda.md)

|-------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Linux (CPU)       | more straight-forward to use | no AWS or GPU Support in this project              |
| Mac (CPU)         | more community support       | no C++ Support in this project (needed for Term 2) |
| Windows (CPU)     | more heavily adopted         | implementation is local and OS specific            |

## [Docker](http://docker.com)  

Get started [here](docs/configured_via_docker.md)

|-------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| AWS (CPU, GPU)    | configure once for all environments | more challenging to use              |
| Linux (CPU, GPU)  | AWS, GPU Support                    | less community support               |
| Mac (CPU)         | practice with `git` and `docker`    | have to manage images and containers |
